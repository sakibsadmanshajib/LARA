# LARA

LARA or LAptop Recommendation Algorithm is an approach to automating one of the few things I find myself often doing, recommending laptops to friends, families or random people on the internet. When I learned writing codes, I planned to write a code which will take input from the user about their preferences, workload type, budget and spit out a list of recommended laptop/s.

This requires me to create a database of existing laptops in Bangladesh's current Laptop Market with their current prices, which is a teadious job to do. The main goal of the program is to do a queries to find the recommendation based on the questions/information the program asked from the user. The questions will ask them about their budget, preferences on what they'll do with the laptop.

# HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM?

* It's pretty simple actually, clone this git and unzip the master branch to a local directory.
* Head over to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest python 3 version.
* Install python 3 in your local machine.
* If you're an windows user, for the sake of simplicity, add python 3 installed directory your system's Environment Path.
* Open, Command prompt/Powershell/Terminal and navigate to the local directory where you unzipped the master branch of the git. Then, execute the python program by typing <code>python LARA.py</code> in your console and press <code>ENTER</code>.
* Follow the instructions in the console window and provide the information.
