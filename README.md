# LARA

LARA or LAptop Recommendation Algorithm is an approach to automating one of the few things I find myself often doing, recommending laptops to friends, families or random people on the internet. When I learned writing codes, I planned to write a code which will take input from the user about their preferences, workload type, budget and spit out a list of recommended laptop/s.

This requires me to create a database of existing laptops in the Bangladesh's Laptop Market with their current prices, which is a teadious job to do. And do the queries to find the recommendation based on the questions/inforamtion the program asked from the user.
